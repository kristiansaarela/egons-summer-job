# Instructions

## Getting started

### Prerequsites

 * Code editor or IDE
 * Git
 * Node and npm
 * Github account (https://github.com/)
 * SSH key added to github account (https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/)

### Recommended software

 * Sublime text 3 (_Code editor_)
 * Cmder with Git (_Enhanced command line. Gives access to basic linux command line tools + git integration_)
 * NodeJS latest (_Javascript runtime environment. This also installs node package manager `npm`_)

## Task #1 - Learning `git`

With this task, you learn how to use basic `git` functionalities - `clone`, `pull`, `add`, `commit` and `push`.

__Note__: For all command line tools (these include `git`, `npm`, `node`), use `cmder`.

 1. Fork this repository in GitHub.
 2. Use `git` to clone your newly forked repository to your laptop.
 3. Create `README.md` file and add some content (title, paragraph).
 4. Push changes to GitHub.

## Task #2 - First application

In this task you will create very basic service. Read more about `npm` - what is `package.json` and why it's needed, how to add dependencies to your project. Learn difference between `npm` and `node`. Read what is web service, what is API.

__Note__: Don't copy code examples!. Write it yourself, that's the only way you remember things and learn.

 1. Start new NodeJS application, use `npm init` to create `package.json` file for this project.
 2. Create `index.js` file where you will start writing code.
 3. Create web service that responds with `yo kriss` when accessed from browser. Use 3rd party library `express` or built in library `net` for that. Google and nodejs documentation will help you here.
 4. Finally, push working application to GitHub.
